# DevX-PocketEdition
DevX in your pocket. <br/>
WIP crack and mod based on DevX Android Edition.
## Why Pocket?
* Fixed sound play and export
* Fixed il2cpp decompiler (it's not even available yet on MAC, but already on android LOL)
* Faster unpacking than AE demo
* Fixed storage permissions request for android 6+ and 10+
* Support ASTC and ETC textures replacing (WIP)
## How get?
**No way now, it's a WIP**
